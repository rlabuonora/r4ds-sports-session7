# Notre Dame 31-23 Loss to Clemson

The following is a football analytics report of the Notre Dame vs Clemson Game.
Some Football Analytics terms should be understood before viewing. They are described
below:

**EPA (Expected Points Added)** is a measure of offensive efficiency and explosiveness. Before each play, a model predicts the expected Points (EP1) that a team will score on a drive based on down, distance, field position, etc.
After the play occurs, a new Expected Points value (EP2) is calculated before the following play. The difference between these Expected Points values is the EPA for the original play (EPA = EP2 - EP1).

This is a list.
